    "prompt": "A documentary-style photograph of two engineers in their late 20s, collaborating intensely at a startup office table with exposed brick walls and mixed seating. They are dressed casually in hoodies and t-shirts, surrounded by laptops displaying code, notebooks with sketches, and coffee mugs. Cool, natural window light with a soft indigo cast fills the workspace, highlighting their focused expressions and the authentic, lived-in environment. Electric violet accents appear subtly in a water bottle and a piece of clothing. The composition uses the rule of thirds, placing the subjects slightly off-center, with 35% negative space in a muted graphite background. The overall mood is calm, purposeful, and intellectually intense, evoking quiet confidence and the satisfaction of problem-solving.",
