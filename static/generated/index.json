    "prompt": "Environmental portrait of a confident Asian male engineer in his late 20s, wearing a casual hoodie and jeans, seated at a desk in a modern startup workspace with exposed brick and large windows. Natural cool-toned window light, medium negative space, authentic technical props such as a laptop with code visible, a coffee cup, and scattered notebooks with diagrams. Calm, focused expression, candid posture—looks like he's in the midst of thoughtful problem-solving. Indigo and graphite tones dominate the scene, with subtle Electric Violet accent in a desk object or clothing detail. The environment feels lived-in and credible, not staged or sterile.",
