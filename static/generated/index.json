    "prompt": "A documentary-style photograph of two engineers in their late 20s, collaborating intensely at a startup office table with exposed brick walls and mixed seating. They are dressed casually in hoodies and t-shirts, surrounded by laptops displaying code, notebooks with sketches, and coffee mugs. Cool, natural window light with a soft indigo cast fills the workspace, highlighting their focused expressions and the authentic, lived-in environment. Electric violet accents appear subtly in a water bottle and a piece of clothing. The composition uses the rule of thirds, placing the subjects slightly off-center, with 35% negative space in a muted graphite background. The overall mood is calm, purposeful, and intellectually intense, evoking quiet confidence and the satisfaction of problem-solving.",

    "prompt": "A documentary-style photograph of two ML engineers in their late 20s collaborating in a modern startup workspace with exposed brick, cool natural window light, and subtle pops of electric violet in clothing or desk objects. The scene conveys calm focus and purposeful problem-solving, with one person leaning in to discuss code on a laptop while the other gestures thoughtfully. The composition uses the rule of thirds, with intentional negative space and muted graphite and zinc tones in the environment. The workspace shows lived-in authenticity with coffee cups, notebooks with mathematical diagrams, and technical books. No screens display dashboards or interfaces, and there are no abstract patterns, tech overlays, or text anywhere in the image.",
